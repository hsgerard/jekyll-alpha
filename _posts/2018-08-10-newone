Hello World! Bruce Wayne, errr...Batman here. Welcome to my new site!

I plan on posting photos of my crime fighting adventures, stories of the many times I have to save Robin and the occasional video of my cooking show, *Cooking with Batman, Live from the BatCave*. I hope you'll follow along and enjoy!

Again, no one as much as I feels the weight of this pain quite so heavily upon myself. Some text here.<a class="footnote">&Dagger;<span>Which, as you may remember, is certainly <i>not</i> my favorite.</span></a> Regardless of these rather unfortuante circumstaces, I remain fully aware and intact of my surrondings.<a class="footnote">&Dagger;<span>Well, within reason, I suppose.</span></a>

Anyway, here's the news.
